            <h1>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h1>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.</p>
            <h3> How to get started</h3>
            <p> (1) Choose a task to be accomplished</p>
            <p> (2) Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)</p>
            <p> (3) Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper </p>
            <p> (4) Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)</p>
            <p> (5) Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break.</p>
